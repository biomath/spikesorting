# spikesorting
Contains pipeline for spike sorting multi-channel data acquired with TDT hardware. Preprocessing steps convert data from TDT native format to -mat  files. Files are then converted to binary (-dat), common average referencing is applied, and data is run through kilosort for sorting. 
In this new version, the pipeline was completed and runs with Kilosort2. Note that this pipeline is still being edited daily, and will be regularly updated and better commented.
